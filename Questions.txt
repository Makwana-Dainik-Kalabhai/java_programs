Que1) c++ vs java:-
______________________

-->C++:-

1) In c++, If we compile code, then convert direct to the machine code.
2) We use vectors(STL-Standard Template Library) for dynamic array.
3) We saves c++ file with .cpp extension.
4) Platform Dependent.
5) can't run on any OS.
6) Compiled language.
7) Memory mgt. is controlled manually.
8) It have goto & virtual keyword.
9) It supports multiple inheritance.
10) Supports operator overloading.
11) Does not support documentation comment.
12) Does not provide built-in support for threading.
13) Object oriented & procedural programming.
14) Uses cin & cout for input & output.
15) Supports structure & union.


-->Java:- 

1) In Java, If we compile the code, then it converts to the byte code then converts to machine code.
2) We use ArrayList, List(import java.util.ArrayList;) for dynamic array in java.
3) Saves with .java extension.
4) Platform Independent.
5) Can run on any OS.
6) Compiled & Interpreter language.
7) Memory mgt. is controlled by the system.
8) It doesn't have goto & virtual keyword.
9) It doesn't support multiple inheritance.
10) Does not support operator overloading.
11) Supports documentation comment(/**Comment*/);
12) Provides built-in support for threading.
13) Only object oriented programming.
14) Uses Scanner class for input & System.out for output.
15) Does not support structure & union.

(pass_by_value in variable, but pass_by_ref in array)



Que-3) Feature of java:-
________________________
1) Simple
2) object-oriented
3) Platform independent
4) Portable (compile on any OS)
5) Secured
6) Robust (Automatic garbage collection)
7) Compiled & Interpreted
8) High performance
9) Multithreaded
10) Dynamic



Que-5) Abstract class vs Interface:-
_____________________________________

--> Abstract class:-

1) Can have abstract & non-abstract methods.
2) Can have static, non-static, final & non-final variables.
3) Provides implementation of interface.
4) Doesn't support multiple inheritance.
5) use abstract keyword.
6) abstract class can extend another class & can implement multiple interfaces.

--> Interface:-

1) Can have only abstract methods.
2) Only have static & final variables.
3) Can't implement abstract class.
4) Supports multiple inheritance.
5) use interface keyword.
6) interface can extend only another interface.
